<em>Re-animating historical figures, or phoning a friend.</em>

This project uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate a conversation with a renowned historical figure. Responses are a combination of information present in the model's dataset plus chosen documents related to their work and associated texts, using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to fine tune the knowledge base.


Available Models:
- Anthropic Claude: A powerful language model for detailed, contextual responses
- Ollama: A local model option for privacy-focused interactions
